> get highest-level explanations:

Yail templates + generators to fill in placeholders (?) + resources (?)
	using rules: not requiring a re-compilation (e.g., enter online location)
	custom Java file: likely more powerful & easier but requires re-compilation 
	or, using Yail ..

on-interaction 
	on-select derivation ..
		ideally just customize existing "scripts" (e.g., fill in custom images)
		or, those customizations could simply be linked to resources

want to avoid creating a new templating language here :-(


(?en0 a :NodeSet)

# en1 could e.g., unify with en0 if final notExists is true
<> log:notIncludes { ?en1!prov:wasGeneratedBy!prov:qualifiedUsage prov:entity ?en0 } .
(?en1 prov:wasGeneratedBy ?gen0) (?gen0 prov:qualifiedUsage ?us0) notExists(?us0 prov:entity ?en0)

# .. or generate a level integer
	(?en1 prov:wasGeneratedBy ?gen0) (?gen0 prov:derivationLevel 0)
->
	(?en1 epm:level 0)


# - generic preprocessing
# why not generate these in the printer .. much easier
# sort antecedents to get "deterministic" output ..



# domain-specific generators

-- selector 
	level of abstraction; contrastive 
	(can be combined)
	
-- generator
	 graphical; short sentences

> contrastive
why this one, and not that one?
	requires a rule analysis

what would it take for me to be in yellow zone?
what would it take not to have to exercise / eat this pizza?
	run backward chainer (or some hacky method)
		goal = some recommendation
		and check which antecedents are missing	


> counter-factual (possibly combined w/ contrastive)
	simply requires re-running the rules with different inputs
	

> scientific
	should be rather straightforward


> trace-based
	should be rather straightforward


> case-based
	.. different type of reasoning (?)
