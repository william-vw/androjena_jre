-- TODO

test COPD case more extensively

joinLinked, .. -> collectAll (list)
	+ dedicated join builtins
problem - lists are not represented natively so will be quite inefficient ..

will not work in case of multiple "reason" derivations
	does work for multiple "recommendation" derivations
likely require updates to collectLinked or something 

improve "template" for individual properties - apply the same one for sets of properties
	(e.g., see cases/copd/data.ttl)

log functor derivation for backward chainer



-- NOTES

> in general, rules need to be very verbosely stated
cannot take shortcuts (e.g., any symptom on 1-10 scale; need to elaborate rules per symptom)
(could somehow auto-generate these verbose rules)

> similarly, for builtin comparisons, "expanding" to short description:
	currently relies on assumption that constant is the second operand


> config per use case

- predicate of interest (e.g., hasDiagnosis, stratified)
there can be plenty of level-0 inferences that are not of interest
	i.e., not used to generate other derivations, but also not representing a conclusion 
		(e.g., an intermediate inference that ended up leading nowhere)


> multiple explanations for inferences of interest
e.g., for COPD: any of a series of inferences may lead to stratification

needed to adapt FRuleEngine to keep (different) derivations of already inferred triple
and, associate descriptions, sentences with derivations instead of node-sets


> non-monotonic rules
.. these constructs are really needed to make these rules feasible
	(countAll, joinAll..)

yes, these lead to race conditions
currently identifying & stratifying "universal" rules in FRuleEngine as with jen3


-- CODE CHANGES

renamed to .txt:
it.polimi.dei.dbgroup.pedigree.androjena.xml.DOMTransformer;

commented out referring code in com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.arp.DOM2Model

edited:
	com.hp.hpl.jena.reasoner.rulesys.Rule.java
	com.hp.hpl.jena.reasoner.rulesys.impl.FRuleEngine.java

added com.hp.hpl.jena.reasoner.rulesys.builtins.MakeSkolem, IsUri, 
	UriStr (not needed), LocalName, CollectAll (& subclasses), SplitOnCase, Trim, NoMatch

in MakeSkolem, edited Base64 call (now java.util)


in general, look for "// edit wvw"
