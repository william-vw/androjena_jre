# AndroJena + PML (JRE)

This version of [AndroJena](https://github.com/lencinhaus/androjena) is extended with support for outputting derivation logs using the [Proof Markup Language (PML)](https://github.com/timrdf/pml).

A bit ironically, this version (= Android version of [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/)) version is actually adapted to run on "regular" (desktop) Java Runtime Edition (JRE) for ease of debugging and experimenting. 
However, the eventual goal is to deploy this library on Android and integrate it with the [Punya](https://github.com/mit-dig/punya) framework.

You will need the [lucenoid_jre](https://github.com/william-vw/lucenoid_jre) and [arqoid_jre](https://github.com/william-vw/arqoid_jre) dependencies.
